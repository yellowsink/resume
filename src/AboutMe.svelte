<!-- separation of concerns baby -->

<p>
  I am a software developer in my free time, and have ~4 years of programming.
  For the past 6 months I have primarily been building plugins for Discord,
  which is a good source of experience for JS and React.

  I am comfortable on the command line, and like to customise my environment
  to be as comfortable for me.
